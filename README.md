# face_detection_recognition-pycharm-
🎯 Real-time Face Recognition using Python | 🔍  encoding-based detection with OpenCV &amp; dlib backend | 📸 Smart webcam-based system


# 👁️‍🗨️ Face Recognition Magic – Python + Webcam + Encoding Power

Lights. Camera. Recognize! 🎬  
This project turns your webcam into a smart face recognizer using Python and the supercharged `face_recognition` library.

## 🔮 What It Can Do
- 🎯 Live face recognition using webcam
- 🧠 Learns your face from `images/` folder
- 🖼️ Draws fancy rectangles with your name

## 🧪 Tech Ingredients
- Python 🐍
- OpenCV 🎥
- face_recognition 💡
- dlib 🧠 (for encoding)

## ⚙️ How to Cook It
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python face_recog.py

⚠️ Privacy Note:
Drop some face images in images/ folder, and boom — it's ready to recognize you!

⚠️ Note: Face dataset is not uploaded for privacy.
Please create your own images/ folder with sample face images before running.
(but i have shared virat and sudeep image for the reference ..so you can check those detection using mobile image ,even that works like real time detection)
